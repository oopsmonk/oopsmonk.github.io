Firefox is extremely slow on my system, include menu, right-click, tab opening...etc.   
*Mozilla Firefox 40.0  
Xubuntu 14.04 LTS 64-bit  
Linux 3.16.0-45-generic #60~14.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jul 24 21:16:23 UTC 2015 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux*  

After I turned off **hardware acceleration**, everything is fine.  
Type this in the browser's address bar to trun it off:  

    about:preferences#advanced
