When I was switching from Vim to Neovim, I use [The 300 line init.lua challenge](https://neovim.discourse.group/t/the-300-line-init-lua-challenge/227) and [wbthomason/packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) for the configuration. the Packer is working fine and has no big problems.

Recently, I switched to [folke/lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) because it has some features that saving a lot of time for users frequently working on a new environment, like me.
- Better TUI design
- Automatically install missing plugins before starting up
- Uses `lazy-lock.json` to track and restore plugins
- Compilation is no needed after plugins changes

**Packer** and **Lazy.nvim** both are great plugin managers, and **Packer** is planning for big improvements on user experience and performance in [Roadmap for Packer v2](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim/blob/refactor/packer-v2/ROADMAP.md). 

if you are new to Neovim:
- [nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) 
- [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/)

if you don't know which plugin manager to use, [the creator of packer.nvim has moved to lazy.nvim at the moment](https://github.com/wbthomason/dotfiles/blob/37d34d0ff29e4370842d4ebbe6a530bc324781f5/dot_config/nvim/init.lua#L5)
