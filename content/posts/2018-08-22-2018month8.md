[What is the difference between const int\*, const int * const, and int const \*?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1143262/what-is-the-difference-between-const-int-const-int-const-and-int-const)  
Read it backwards (as driven by [Clockwise/Spiral Rule](http://c-faq.com/decl/spiral.anderson.html)):  
`int*` - pointer to int  
`int const *` - pointer to const int  
`int * const` - const pointer to int  
`int const *` const - const pointer to const int  

Now the first const can be on either side of the type so:  
`const int *` == `int const *`  
`const int * const` == `int const * const`  

If you want to go really crazy you can do things like this:  
`int **` - pointer to pointer to int  
`int ** const` - a const pointer to a pointer to an int  
`int * const *` - a pointer to a const pointer to an int  
`int const **` - a pointer to a pointer to a const int  
`int * const * const` - a const pointer to a const pointer to an int  

`const X* p` means "p points to an X that is const": **the X object can't be changed via p.**  
`X* const p` means "p is a const pointer to an X that is non-const": **you can't change the pointer p itself, but you can change the X object via p.**  
`const X* const p` means "p is a const pointer to an X that is const": **you can't change the pointer p itself, nor can you change the X object via p.**
