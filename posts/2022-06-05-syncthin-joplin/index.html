Device ID could be found at Show ID in Actions menu, copy or write it down for later use.\nEnabling Syncthing Automatically You can start Syncthing automatically by 2 ways on Unix-like systems, a system service or an user service.\nFor Raspberry Pi, I would setup a system service since it runs as a server role, somehow the service has been setup after installation, I found syncthing.service under /.config/systemd/user/default.target.wants. I’d recommend to restart the Raspberry Pi for checking if Syncthing is shown in the process status(ps -axf), if it’s not there you can follow How to set up a system service\nFor Ubuntu PC, I setup the Desktop Entry, just simply copy script into ~/.config/autostart/ folder. see Using the Desktop Environment\n$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syncthing/syncthing/main/etc/linux-desktop/syncthing-start.desktop -O .config/autostart/syncthing-start.desktop Adding A Remote Device Second, Repeat previous to install Syncthing on the remote device which is an Ubuntu PC. After installing Syncthing on both Raspberry Pi and PC, you are ready to create a sync folder via the Syncthing service.

The drawbacks are services maintenance is on yourself and troubleshooting is not easy if you have no basic understanding about how these tools work.
